The Health Metrics Tracker is working functionally, but the UI looks like a static Notion page: too much text, big “Step 1/2/3” headings, and long paragraphs. I want a cleaner, more app-like design that is visually appealing and easy to scan.

Please MODIFY the Streamlit UI code (🏋️‍♂️_app.py and any related front-end helpers). Do not touch the core backend logic or database models. Focus on layout, styling and microcopy.

========================================
1. OVERALL STYLE
========================================

Goals:

- Look like a modern web app dashboard, not a document.
- Less explanatory text, more visual structure.
- Clear primary focus on **today’s metrics and summary**.
- Use cards, subtle backgrounds and spacing so the eye knows where to look.

Visual guidelines:

- Use a light grey page background and white card containers (e.g. via `st.container()` + `st.markdown` with simple CSS).
- Use one accent colour (e.g. the existing orange) for key elements only: active tab, primary buttons, key numbers.
- Use short headings, not long sentences.
- Reduce bold paragraphs of text; prefer compact helper text or tooltips.

========================================
2. NEW PAGE LAYOUT (TODAY TAB)
========================================

Keep the same functionality but restructure **Today** into three horizontal bands:

Top band – header + step indicators  
Middle band – live metrics + summary  
Bottom band – food journal

### 2.1 Header area

Replace the current big title + long sentence + “Step 1/2/3/4” explanation with:

- Left side:
  - App title: “Health Metrics Tracker”
  - Short subtitle in smaller, lighter font: “Log today. Watch trends over time.”
- Right side:
  - Date picker
  - A small status pill (“Ready”, “Saving…”, etc., which you already have)
  - “Clear this day” button (as a small text or outline button, not a big red bar)

Directly under the header, add a **step indicator bar** instead of huge “Step 1/2/3” headings, for example:

[1 Date & goal] → [2 Daily metrics] → [3 Food journal] → [4 Summary]

This can be a simple horizontal row of labels with subtle icons. No need for real navigation logic, just visual guidance.

Remove the giant “Step 1: Select Date & Goal” heading. The step indicator row replaces it.

### 2.2 Two-column main area

Below the step bar, create a two-column layout:

- **Left column (wider, ~65%)**: Today’s metrics and summary.
- **Right column (narrower, ~35%)**: Goal settings and daily metric inputs.

Left column content:

1. **Today’s Summary card**

   - One compact card with:
     - Mode name (e.g. “Standard Weight Loss”).
     - Three big numbers in a single row:
       - Eaten
       - Burned
       - Balance (make this the most visually prominent, with green/amber/red colour).
     - Two slim progress bars underneath:
       - Calories eaten vs today’s dynamic target.
       - Protein vs protein target.
   - 1–2 short lines of plain-English text underneath, no more. Example:
     “You have eaten 1,120 kcal of your 2,500 kcal target (45%) and are in a 1,380 kcal deficit so far. Protein is 30 g of 150 g, which is low for today.”

2. **Weekly & monthly trends**

   - Move the weekly/monthly stats into a compact card under the summary.
   - Use a simple two-column layout inside that card:
     - Left: last 7 days (avg burn, avg deficit, avg protein, avg weight).
     - Right: last 30 days.
   - Keep labels short and use smaller font; this card is secondary.

Right column content:

1. **Goal mode & advanced settings**

   - Small card titled “Goal”.
   - Inside: a compact dropdown for Goal Mode, with a short one-line helper, for example:
     - “Choose maintenance or your preferred weight-loss speed.”
   - Below, an `st.expander("Advanced goal settings")` with:
     - Fallback maintenance calories
     - Rolling window days
     - Loss percentages sliders
   - Use a small “Save goal” button within the expander only.

2. **Daily metrics mini-form**

   - Another small card titled “Today’s inputs”.
   - Inputs:
     - Weight (kg)
     - Steps
     - Total calories burned
     - Protein target (if editable)
   - Lay them out in two columns.
   - Auto-save on change as you already planned; keep any visible “Save metrics” button very minimal or remove it if not needed.

### 2.3 Food journal band

Below the two-column band, use the full width for the Food Journal:

- Title: “Food journal (today)”
- A simple “Add entry” row at the top, styled like a single line form:
  - Time, Meal, Calories, Protein, and an icon/button for “More details” to reveal place, V/L, * and context.
- Below, show entries as **stacked cards** rather than a dense table:
  - Each card:
    - Top row: time + meal tag on the left, calories and protein badges on the right.
    - Middle row: food text.
    - Optional bottom row: context/comments in smaller grey text.
    - Small trash icon in one corner to delete.
- Keep table-style columns only on the **History** tab, not here.

========================================
3. HISTORY TAB CLEAN-UP
========================================

For the History tab:

- Remove the huge text description on the left that explains features; that belongs in code comments, not the UI.
- Keep a clean layout:
  - A table of days at the top.
  - Two charts below (Weight over time, 7-day rolling balance, and optionally protein trend).
- Add a short one-line helper at the top, e.g. “Review how your weight, calories and protein have changed over time.”

========================================
4. MICROCOPY & VISUAL TIDY-UP
========================================

- Remove long instructional paragraphs from the main page. Replace them with:
  - The short subtitle under the main title.
  - A short helper line under the step bar.
  - Tooltips or `help=` text on more complex controls.
- Make sure all buttons have clear, short labels:
  - “Clear day”
  - “Save goal”
  - “Add entry”
- Reduce fonts where possible so the page feels light, not shouty.
- Ensure cards have consistent padding and rounded corners, and that spacing between sections is generous.

========================================
5. WHAT TO KEEP UNCHANGED
========================================

- Do NOT change any API endpoints or database schema.
- Keep all dynamic logic: auto-saving metrics, dynamic calorie targets from rolling burn, protein targets, weekly/monthly stats, CBT-E fields, and the Clear-day endpoint.
- Only change layout, styling and wording so the app feels more like a clean dashboard and less like a text document.

After you modify the code, run the app and verify that:
- The Today tab opens with the new header, step bar, two-column layout, and food-journal cards.
- All existing functionality still works as before.
