That's much better I love the design and the animation but I don't want to be positioning my personal experience like a CV or LinkedIn page but rather To design a landing page with a funnel that positions me as a BI / Data / AI / Analytics consultant, we want to:
	1.	Establish trust and authority.
	2.	Qualify the visitor’s pain points or goals.
	3.	Direct them to the next step based on their level of readiness.

Here’s a clear, funnel-oriented structure for your landing page:

⸻

🎯 Top of Page (Hook)

Headline:

“Unlock Clarity from Your Data. Fast.”
Subheadline:
“I help teams design self-service dashboards, modernise BI stacks, and accelerate time-to-insight using AI and analytics.”

CTA:
