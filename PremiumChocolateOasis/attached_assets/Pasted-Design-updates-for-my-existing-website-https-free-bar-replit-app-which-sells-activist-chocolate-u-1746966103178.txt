Design updates for my existing website https://free-bar.replit.app, which sells activist chocolate under the theme: “This Bar Is a Protest.” Keep the same bold visual aesthetic (red/green/paper-texture, protest-inspired, Arabic type hints). Incorporate the following:

1. 🔁 Contribute Call-to-Action Section
	•	Add a new section below or beside the “Shop Now” buttons with this copy:
Want to help, but not ready to buy?
Give us feedback, share your skills, or join our crew.
We’re a movement, not a company.
No leaders. Only trusted servants.
[Join Us →] (Button scrolls to form)

2. 📝 Participation Form (Form Details)
	•	Embed a form with the following fields:
	•	Name (optional)
	•	Email (required)
	•	What would you like to do? (multi-select checkboxes):
	•	Give feedback on the chocolate or site
	•	Help make chocolate
	•	Share on socials
	•	Sell or distribute Free Bar

	•	Other (with free text box)
	•	Optional: Message box
	•	Form submissions should:
	•	Store in a Google Sheet / database
	•	Trigger an optional confirmation email (use a free service like Formspree or Netlify Forms)

3. 📱 QR Landing Page
	•	Create a mobile-first separate page, designed for QR codes at in-person protests:
	•	Keep headline: “This Bar Is a Protest”
	•	Short description + form (same as above)
	•	Include a chocolate bar image + CTA: “Join the Movement”
	•	Light loading speed and responsive design
	•	URL path: /join (e.g. https://free-bar.replit.app/join)

4. 🪙 NFT Infrastructure
	•	Create a new page /nft explaining the NFT fundraiser:
	•	Headline: Own a piece of chocolate history
	•	Body: “Support the first activist Palestinian chocolate bar by minting a limited-edition digital artwork. All proceeds help fund our launch and production.”
	•	Mint options (even 1 NFT): use Zora, Mirror.xyz or Manifold.xyz
	•	Add wallet connection (e.g. WalletConnect or MetaMask)
	•	Include a waitlist form for those unfamiliar with NFTs
	•	Optional: embed the live minting widget from Zora or Mirror
	•	Page layout must be responsive, clear, and values-aligned. Include:
	•	Art preview (e.g. Free Bar with tagline “This Bar Is a Protest”)
	•	FAQ section on how NFTs support the project and why we’re doing this
	•	Legal disclaimer
