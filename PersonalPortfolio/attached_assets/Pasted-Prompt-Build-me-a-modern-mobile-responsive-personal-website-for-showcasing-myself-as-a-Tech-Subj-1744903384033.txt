Prompt:

	Build me a modern, mobile-responsive personal website for showcasing myself as a Tech Subject Matter Expert, focusing on:
		•	Data Analytics
	•	Data Integration
	•	AI/ML
	•	Continuous Learning
	•	Tech Sales
	•	Solutions Engineering

	I am not selling anything—this is a professional profile and learning hub that supports both my own learning journey and my community’s. The website should include content I create (e.g. YouTube videos, TikToks, LinkedIn Lives) and highlight local meetups or events I run or attend.

	Design & Framework:
		•	Use React.js + TypeScript
	•	Tailwind CSS for styling
	•	Mobile-first, fully responsive

	Key Features:

	1. Hero Section
		•	Bold, inspirational headline about being a tech educator, content creator and SME
	•	Subheadline describing key focus areas: data, AI, sales engineering, and community learning
	•	CTAs: “Watch My Latest Video”, “Join My Meetup”
	•	Lazy-loaded video thumbnail with play button (e.g. YouTube embed)

	2. About/Blueprint Section
		•	A scrollable card or visual timeline showing my learning journey and content creation process (learning → experimenting → teaching → community sharing)
	•	Icons, titles, and descriptions per step

	3. Content Hub Section
		•	Embedded playlists or thumbnails linking to:
	•	YouTube videos
	•	LinkedIn Lives
	•	TikToks / Shorts
	•	Option to filter/sort content by topic or platform

	4. Events & Meetups Section
		•	Upcoming events I’m hosting or attending
	•	Integration with Google Calendar or a custom list with date, location, and RSVP link

	5. Testimonials Section
		•	Short quotes or stories from community members/mentees about how my content or mentoring helped them
	•	Name, photo, outcome if available

	6. Email Signup Section
		•	Encourages people to join my mailing list for content drops, event invites, and learning updates
	•	Integrate with ConvertKit

	7. FAQ Section
		•	Short questions and answers like:
	•	“What topics do you cover?”
	•	“How can I join your meetups?”
	•	“Do you mentor people one-on-one?”

	Optional (but nice to have):
		•	A “Now” page (à la Derek Sivers) listing what I’m currently learning or building
	•	Social proof / media logos if I’ve been featured anywhere

	Technical Implementation:
		•	Lazy loading for images/videos
	•	Error handling for video playback
	•	Input validation for forms
	•	Analytics (Google Analytics 4)
	•	Fully mobile-optimised (touch targets, spacing, readable text)
	•	SEO-ready (basic meta tags, social sharing previews)

	Deliverables:
		•	Complete website build with React + Tailwind
	•	ConvertKit signup form integration
	•	YouTube + LinkedIn embed integration
	•	Mobile/responsive tested
	•	Google Analytics enabled

	No checkout, pricing, or sales flows needed.
