You are an expert full stack engineer and product designer. Build a visually appealing, interactive habit tracker + weekly planner web app inspired by the attached spreadsheet (treat it as the UX reference, not a literal UI).

GOAL
Create a modern, fast, mobile friendly app that replicates:
1) Weekly planner with day cards (Mon to Sun) showing tasks, checkboxes, per day completion percentage, and a ring chart.
2) Monthly habit tracker with a habit list and a calendar style grid (days 1 to 31), showing completion per day, overall month progress, and analytics.
3) Analytics page with per habit progress, streaks, completion rate, and simple charts.

TECH STACK (preferred)
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind
- Charts: Recharts (ring / doughnut, bars, line)
- State management: simple React state + local persistence
- Persistence: use browser localStorage first, plus optional SQLite or Postgres later
- If you choose Next.js, do it. Otherwise Vite is fine.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Clean, minimal, “calm productivity” aesthetic: soft greys, whites, one accent colour (green) like the sheet
- Cards with rounded corners, subtle shadows
- Micro animations on toggle, progress changes
- Works beautifully on mobile (responsive layout)
- Dark mode toggle

CORE DATA MODEL
- Habit: { id, name, emoji?, targetPerWeek (default 7), isActive }
- DailyHabitLog: { dateISO, habitId, done:boolean }
- PlannerDay: { dateISO, tasks: Task[] }
- Task: { id, title, done, tags?, priority?, notes? }

FEATURES
Weekly Planner
- Week selector (this week, previous, next)
- Each day is a card with:
  - Big ring chart completion (tasks done / total)
  - Task list with checkbox toggles
  - Add task inline, edit, delete, reorder (drag and drop optional)
  - Quick add templates (e.g. “Gym”, “Reading”, “Cold shower”)
  - Completed and Not Completed counts

Monthly Habits
- Month selector
- Habit list on the left, days grid on the right (1..31)
- Clicking a cell toggles done for that habit on that day
- Daily completion percentage row (like sheet)
- Overall month progress (progress bar)
- Streak calculation per habit (current streak, best streak)
- Ability to add, rename, reorder habits
- Optional: “Skip” state (neither done nor missed) for days before tracking started

Analytics
- Overall completion rate for month and week
- Per habit progress bars (with goal vs actual)
- Charts:
  - Line chart: daily completion percentage over the month
  - Bar chart: habit completion counts
- Small insights panel:
  - Top 3 habits by consistency
  - Lowest habit this month
  - Best day of week

IMPORT / EXPORT
- Export data to JSON (download)
- Import JSON to restore
- Optional: export a CSV or XLSX summary (nice to have)

SPREADSHEET AS INSPIRATION
- Use the spreadsheet visuals as inspiration:
  - ring charts for progress
  - progress bars
  - day and habit grids
- Do NOT literally embed a spreadsheet UI.
- But include an “About” or “Reference” modal that shows a screenshot of the sheet (optional).

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1) Scaffold app (Vite or Next) with Tailwind and Recharts.
2) Create core pages: Weekly, Monthly, Analytics.
3) Implement data layer with localStorage persistence:
   - A single `useAppStore()` hook that loads/saves state.
4) Build Weekly Planner UI.
5) Build Monthly Habits grid with efficient rendering.
6) Add Analytics calculations and charts.
7) Add polish: dark mode, animations, empty states, keyboard shortcuts (optional).

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- I can add tasks, tick them off, see progress update instantly.
- I can add habits, toggle day cells, see streaks and charts update.
- Data persists on refresh.
- UI looks “premium” and is pleasant to use.

DELIVERABLES
- Working app in Replit
- Clear README with:
  - how to run
  - how data is stored
  - how to import/export
  - where to change theme colours
- Seed data resembling the spreadsheet example habits (Wake up early, Gym, Reading/Learning, Budget tracking, Project work, No alcohol, Social media detox, Goal journaling, Cold shower). Avoid explicit adult content in default seed data.

Start now by scaffolding the project, then implement the core features before optional extras.
