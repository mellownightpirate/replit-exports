You already know the app context and existing codebase. Implement the following changes and redeploy.

PRIORITY 0: REMOVE TASKS FUNCTIONALITY ENTIRELY (FOR NOW)
- Remove all task UI, routes, API endpoints, and navigation related to tasks and weekly planning.
- The app should focus only on:
  - Anchors (formerly habits)
  - Buddies
  - Projects (including shared projects)
  - Public discovery + follows
  - “Seen” accountability on Anchor check ins
- If a Tasks table exists in DB, you may keep it temporarily to avoid breaking migrations, but it must not be used anywhere in UI or API.
- Update copy so the product language no longer references tasks.

PRIORITY 1: CLICKING AN ANCHOR OPENS A STATUS UPDATE PANEL
Goal: Tapping an Anchor anywhere (Today, Anchors list, buddy view, project view) opens a mobile bottom sheet with meaningful metrics.

UX
- Mobile first bottom sheet, scrollable, with a clear header: Anchor name + emoji.
- Include a timeframe selector: Week, Month, All time (default Month).
- Show key stats:
  - Target: X times per week (or X per period) based on the Anchor configuration
  - Completed: Y out of Z (Z depends on timeframe and target)
  - Completion rate (percentage)
  - Current streak and best streak
  - Last check in date
- Include a simple visual:
  - For Month: mini calendar heatmap or a 30 day grid showing done vs not done
  - For Week: bar or dots for each day
- Include “Edit Anchor” and “Archive Anchor” actions.

Data
- Use existing Anchor and AnchorLog (check in) data.
- Ensure calculations are correct with timezone.

PRIORITY 2: “SEEN” MUST BE PER ANCHOR CHECK IN (NOT PER DAY, NOT PER TASK)
Since tasks are removed, implement Seen per Anchor completion event, meaning:
- A buddy can mark an individual Anchor check in as “Seen” to acknowledge they saw that the buddy completed that Anchor on that date.
- Each buddy can mark Seen independently.
- The owner can see which buddies have marked Seen on each Anchor check in.

Data model
Create a new table (Prisma) called AnchorSeen (or CheckinSeen):
- id
- anchorLogId (the completion record for a given anchorId + dateISO)
- subjectUserId (owner of the log)
- viewerUserId (buddy who marked seen)
- createdAt
Constraints:
- unique(anchorLogId, viewerUserId)

Rules
- Only allow Seen if the AnchorLog indicates done = true.
- If a completion is toggled back to not done, delete all AnchorSeen rows for that anchorLogId automatically.
- Only accepted buddies can create AnchorSeen for each other.
- Respect privacy settings:
  - If the buddy hides anchor details, still allow Seen but render the row as “Completed Anchor” with an index label.

API
- POST /api/anchorLogs/:anchorLogId/seen (create or toggle on)
- DELETE /api/anchorLogs/:anchorLogId/seen (toggle off)
- When fetching buddy check ins for a date, include:
  - seenBy (array of viewerUserIds) or seenCount
  - viewerHasSeen for the current viewer

UI changes
Buddy view (for a selected date, default Today):
- Show the buddy’s list of Anchors for that date, each with completion state (read only).
- For each completed Anchor row, show an eye icon toggle “Seen”.
- Disabled if not completed.
Owner view:
- For each completed Anchor today, show avatars or count of buddies who have seen it.
- Allow tapping to open a list of who marked Seen.

PRIORITY 3: PUBLIC PROJECTS MUST BE JOINABLE BY OTHER USERS
Problem: Buddies are not able to join public projects, fix this end to end.

Requirements
- Project has visibility: PRIVATE | BUDDIES_ONLY | PUBLIC
- Add a flag allowPublicJoin boolean (default false)
- If visibility = PUBLIC and allowPublicJoin = true, any authenticated user can join.
- Joining creates a ProjectMember row with status ACTIVE (no pending for now).
- Add Leave project action.
- Project owner can remove members.

Discovery and UI
- In Projects discovery or on a public project page, show:
  - Join button if not a member
  - Leave button if a member
- Ensure the join button is visible to buddies and non buddies if the project is public and joinable.

Security
- Only show public projects in discovery if visibility = PUBLIC.
- Only show join for allowPublicJoin = true.
- Enforce membership checks for viewing non public projects.

PRIORITY 4: FOLLOW GRAPH ON PUBLIC PROFILES (WHO FOLLOWS WHO)
Add “Follow” as a separate concept from Buddies.

Data model
Add Follow table:
- id
- followerId
- followingId
- createdAt
Constraints:
- unique(followerId, followingId)
Rules:
- Only allow following a user who has isPublic = true.
- Prevent following yourself.

API
- POST /api/follow/:username (follow)
- DELETE /api/follow/:username (unfollow)
- GET /api/users/:username/publicProfile should include:
  - followersCount, followingCount
  - viewerIsFollowing boolean
Optional:
- Endpoints to list followers and following with pagination.

UI
Public buddy profile (when the target is public):
- Show Followers and Following counts.
- Add a Follow / Following button.
- Add a section that lists followers and following (with pagination) if the profile allows it.

Privacy controls
- Add settings for public users:
  - showFollowerList boolean (default true)
  - showFollowingList boolean (default true)
If false, show counts only.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- No tasks UI exists anywhere, navigation is updated accordingly.
- Tapping an Anchor opens a bottom sheet showing correct progress metrics and visuals.
- Seen works per Anchor completion record, buddies can mark Seen, owner can see who marked Seen, Seen clears if completion is undone.
- Public projects marked joinable can be joined by other users, including non buddies.
- Public profiles show follow relationships, and users can follow/unfollow.

DELIVERABLES
- Prisma migrations for new tables/fields (AnchorSeen, Follow, allowPublicJoin, follower list privacy flags)
- Updated APIs
- Updated mobile first UI
- Quick README update describing Seen per Anchor check in and public project joining and follows
- Redeploy and verify the public URL works.
