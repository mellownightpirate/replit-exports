You already have the app code and context. Make the following fixes and upgrades, then redeploy so https://accountability-game.replit.app/ works reliably on desktop and mobile.

1) FIX “SERVICE UNAVAILABLE” ON DESKTOP
Goal: the public URL loads consistently and never returns “Service unavailable”.

Do this first:
- Check Replit deployment logs for crashes, missing env vars, and port binding issues.
- Ensure the server binds to host 0.0.0.0 and uses process.env.PORT (do not hardcode 3000 unless PORT is absent).
- Confirm the Replit start command is correct for this stack (Next.js or Express). Make sure it starts a single web process.
- Add a /health route that always returns 200 with JSON { ok: true, timestamp }.
- Add robust error logging on boot (log PORT, NODE_ENV, and whether DB connection succeeded).
- If the server depends on DB, fail gracefully:
  - Show a friendly “Temporarily unavailable” page if DB is down
  - Do not crash loop
- Validate that all required environment variables are present in Replit Secrets and that Prisma migrations are applied in the deployed environment.
- If using Next.js, ensure the build output and start method are compatible with Replit hosting.

Acceptance:
- Visiting the URL from a desktop browser loads the app.
- /health returns 200.
- No crash loop in logs.

2) CHANGE TERMINOLOGY: STOP SAYING “HABITS”
Replace “Habits” in the UI with a new, intuitive, original term used everywhere in the product copy.

Use the term: “Anchors”.
Examples:
- “Add Anchor”, “My Anchors”, “Anchor streak”, “Anchor grid”, “Anchor check in”
- Use “anchored” as the adjective where needed (example: “anchored days”)

Implementation notes:
- Do not rename database tables unless necessary, keep internal model names if you want.
- Create a single copy/terminology map file so wording is consistent across UI, emails, wizard steps, empty states.
- Update routes, nav labels, buttons, headings, tooltips.

Acceptance:
- No user facing “habit” wording remains (except possibly internal code comments).

3) CHANGE “SEEN” TO BE PER TASK (NOT PER DAY)
The Seen feature must be per task, meaning:
- A buddy can mark an individual task as “Seen” to acknowledge they saw that you completed that task today.
- Each buddy can mark each task as seen independently.
- The task owner can see which buddies have seen each task.

Data model:
- Create a TaskSeen table/collection:
  - id
  - taskId
  - subjectUserId (owner of task, for security and querying)
  - viewerUserId (buddy who marked seen)
  - createdAt
  - unique constraint: (taskId, viewerUserId)

Rules:
- Only allow “Seen” when task.done is true.
- If the task is later toggled back to not done, automatically remove TaskSeen records for that task (so Seen always reflects “seen completed”).
- Only accepted buddies can create TaskSeen for each other.
- Respect privacy settings:
  - If task titles are hidden to buddies, still show the task as “Completed task” with an index label, and allow Seen based on completion state.

API:
- POST /api/tasks/:taskId/seen (toggle on, or create)
- DELETE /api/tasks/:taskId/seen (toggle off)
- GET tasks should include seenBy: [viewerUserId] or a count, plus viewerHasSeen boolean for the current viewer.

UI changes:
- On Buddy view for a specific date (default today), show the buddy’s tasks list.
  - Each completed task row has a “Seen” toggle (eye icon).
  - Disable if task not completed.
- On my Today view, each completed task shows avatars or a count of buddies who have seen it.
- Add a filter on buddy view for date (today, yesterday, pick date).

Acceptance:
- I can mark a buddy’s completed task as Seen.
- Buddy can mark mine as Seen.
- We each see Seen indicators per task.
- Seen resets if task becomes not done.

4) MAKE THE WIZARD ACCESSIBLE ANYTIME
Currently onboarding wizard exists, but I need to be able to run it again any time.

Add:
- A “Guides” or “Wizards” section in Profile (or Settings) with:
  - “Getting started wizard”
  - “Projects and shared goals wizard” (if it exists)
  - “Public discovery wizard” (if it exists)
- Each wizard can be started from scratch or resumed.
- Store wizard completion state per wizard id in DB, but allow manual restart.

Implementation:
- Create a WizardRegistry with wizard metadata (id, name, description).
- Add a generic WizardRunner that can launch from anywhere and handle navigation to the right tab/screen.
- Add a small help icon entry point on key screens (Today, Anchors, Buddies, Projects) that opens the wizard list.

Acceptance:
- I can start the wizard from Profile at any time.
- I can restart it even if previously completed.

5) FIX BUDDY “ANCHORS” LIST GETTING CUT OFF
In Buddy detail view, scrolling their anchors gets cut off after the fourth item. Fix the layout so the list is fully scrollable and shows all anchors.

Likely causes:
- fixed height container with overflow hidden
- nested scroll container issues on mobile

Fix:
- Use standard page scroll where possible.
- If using a scrollable container, ensure it has correct flex sizing and overflow-y-auto, and that the parent allows it to grow.
- Add spacing and safe area padding so the bottom items are not hidden behind bottom nav.
- Test with 10+ anchors.

Acceptance:
- I can scroll and see all anchors for a buddy on mobile and desktop.

DELIVERABLES
- Code changes implemented cleanly
- DB migrations applied (Prisma)
- Updated UI copy (Anchors)
- Working deployment on Replit with the public URL accessible
- Brief README note describing TaskSeen and how to run wizards manually
Proceed in this order: (1) service unavailable fix, (2) layout cut off fix, (3) Anchors terminology, (4) TaskSeen per task, (5) wizard entry points.
