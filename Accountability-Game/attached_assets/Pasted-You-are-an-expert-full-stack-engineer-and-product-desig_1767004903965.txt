You are an expert full stack engineer and product designer. Build a mobile first, visually polished habit tracker + weekly planner web app inspired by my spreadsheet concept, but expanded into a multi user accountability platform.

HIGH LEVEL CONCEPT
- Users create an account, sign in, and track habits + daily tasks.
- Users can “connect” with other users (accountability buddies).
- Each user can choose what parts of their tracking are visible to others (at minimum: habits list + daily completion state).
- Buddies can view each other’s dashboards and provide “accountability acknowledgements” each day (a simple mechanism to mark: “I saw it” / “Held accountable”).
- The app is mobile first, thumb friendly, fast, and feels like a modern consumer app.

TECH STACK (choose a path that works well in Replit)
Preferred:
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Auth: NextAuth (or Clerk if easiest on Replit)
- Database: Postgres (Neon/Supabase) via Prisma ORM
- Charts: Recharts
Alternative acceptable:
- Remix or Express + React + Vite, with a straightforward auth solution

MOBILE FIRST UX REQUIREMENTS
- Default layout is mobile: bottom tab navigation (Weekly, Monthly, Buddies, Analytics, Profile)
- Big tap targets, sticky primary actions, minimal text density
- Home screen shows: today’s completion ring, today’s tasks, and today’s habits quick toggle
- Smooth micro animations on toggles and progress changes
- Dark mode toggle
- Works perfectly on iPhone sized screens first, then scales up for desktop

CORE FEATURES
1) Authentication and Accounts
- Sign up, sign in, sign out
- Email + password (or magic link), plus optional OAuth later
- User profile: display name, timezone, avatar (optional)
- Store timezone and use it for “today” boundaries

2) Tracking Model
- Habits: name, emoji/icon, active flag, optional target frequency
- Daily habit logs: per habit, per dateISO, done boolean
- Daily tasks (weekly planner style): tasks belong to a date, with done boolean and optional notes
- The app must support both: daily habits grid (month view) and day task list (today view / week view)

3) Buddies / Accountability Network
- Users can connect to each other:
  - Invite flow: send invite by username or email
  - Accept / decline
  - Once connected, both can view each other’s shared tracking
- Privacy controls:
  - Each user can set visibility: Public to buddies (default), Private
  - At minimum, allow: share habits list, share daily completion status, share tasks list titles (optional)
  - Allow hiding task titles while still showing completion counts, if user prefers

4) Buddy Views
- “Buddies” tab shows a list of connected buddies with:
  - Their today completion percentage
  - Their streak highlight (optional)
  - A “nudge” / “check in” button
- Buddy profile screen shows:
  - Their habits list (as shared)
  - Today: completion ring, habit toggles as read only, tasks completion summary
  - Month grid view (read only) for overall consistency

5) Accountability Acknowledgement Mechanism
Add a simple, explicit mechanism so buddies can mark they have checked in:
- Each day has an “Accountability” section for each user:
  - Buddies can tap: “Seen” (acknowledge they reviewed today)
  - Optional: “Approved” (means you believe they did it) plus a short comment
- Store acknowledgements as records:
  - { id, dateISO, subjectUserId (whose day is being acknowledged), buddyUserId (who acknowledged), type: "seen"|"approved", comment?, createdAt }
- UI for the subject user:
  - On Today screen, show avatars of buddies who tapped “Seen” or “Approved”
  - Push style indicator in app (no push notifications required, but show badges)
- UI for the buddy:
  - On buddy’s today screen, show “Mark as Seen” and “Approve” actions
- Prevent spam:
  - Each buddy can only acknowledge a user once per day per type
  - Allow editing comment within 10 minutes (optional)

6) Weekly Planner (Tasks)
- Week selector
- Each day: tasks list with add/edit/delete, done toggles
- Day card shows completion ring and counts

7) Monthly Habits
- Month selector
- Habit rows with day cells 1..31, tap to toggle
- Daily completion percentage row
- Overall month progress bar

8) Analytics
- Daily completion line chart for month
- Per habit completion bars
- Simple insights panel (best day, most consistent habit)

DATA AND DATABASE
Use Prisma with Postgres. Suggested tables:
- User (id, email, passwordHash or authProvider fields, name, timezone, createdAt)
- Habit (id, userId, name, emoji, isActive, createdAt)
- HabitLog (id, userId, habitId, dateISO, done, createdAt) unique(userId, habitId, dateISO)
- Task (id, userId, dateISO, title, done, notes?, createdAt)
- BuddyConnection (id, requesterId, receiverId, status: PENDING|ACCEPTED|DECLINED, createdAt) unique pair
- VisibilitySetting (id, userId, shareHabits, shareHabitStatus, shareTasksTitles, shareTasksCountsOnly)
- Acknowledgement (id, dateISO, subjectUserId, buddyUserId, type, comment?, createdAt) unique(subjectUserId, buddyUserId, dateISO, type)

SECURITY AND ACCESS CONTROL
- Enforce row level access in the API:
  - Users can read/write only their own habits/logs/tasks
  - Buddies can read only what is shared via visibility settings
  - Buddies can create acknowledgements only for accepted connections
- Validate inputs, rate limit invite creation (lightweight), and sanitise comments

API DESIGN
- Use Next.js server actions or route handlers:
  - /api/habits, /api/habitLogs
  - /api/tasks
  - /api/buddies/invite, /api/buddies/accept, /api/buddies/list
  - /api/buddies/[id]/overview (read buddy shared data)
  - /api/acknowledgements/create, /api/acknowledgements/list
- Keep it simple and production ready

UI SPEC
- Bottom nav tabs: Today (or Weekly), Monthly, Buddies, Analytics, Profile
- Today screen:
  - Completion ring
  - Quick toggles for today habits
  - Today tasks list
  - Accountability section showing buddy acknowledgements (avatars + count)
- Buddy detail screen:
  - Their today summary and “Mark as Seen” / “Approve” actions
  - Optional comment modal for “Approve”

SEED DATA
- On first account creation, add default habits (safe and neutral): Wake up early, Gym, Reading/Learning, Budget tracking, Project work, No alcohol, Social media detox, Goal journaling, Cold shower.
- Do not include explicit adult content in defaults.

DELIVERABLES
- Working mobile first app in Replit
- Fully functional auth, database, and buddy accountability
- README with:
  - setup instructions for Postgres
  - environment variables
  - how to run migrations
  - how buddy connections and acknowledgements work
  - notes on privacy settings

BUILD ORDER
1) Scaffold Next.js + Tailwind + Prisma + Auth
2) Implement core tracking (habits + tasks) with local UI
3) Add month + week views
4) Add buddies connect flow
5) Add buddy view read only access + privacy settings
6) Add acknowledgements mechanism and UI
7) Add analytics + polish (dark mode, animations, responsive)

Start by scaffolding the project and implementing authentication + database schema + a minimal “Today” screen, then build upward from there.
