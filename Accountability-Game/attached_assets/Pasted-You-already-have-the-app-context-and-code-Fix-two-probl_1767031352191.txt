You already have the app context and code. Fix two problems:

1) I CANNOT NAVIGATE TO A BUDDY DETAIL PAGE TO MARK “SEEN/WATCHING”
Current behaviour: in the Buddies area, I only see reactions, I cannot open a buddy detail page where I can view their Anchors for a day and mark them as Seen/Watching.

Goal: Buddy list items must be tappable and open a Buddy Detail screen. On that screen I can:
- Select a date (default today)
- See the buddy’s Anchors for that date
- See which Anchors are completed
- For each completed Anchor, I can mark it as Seen (eye icon) (and optionally Watching if that concept exists)
- The UI must not be just “reactions”, it must support the explicit Seen interaction on individual Anchor check ins.

Implementation requirements
A) Routing/navigation
- Ensure there is a stable route like /buddies/[buddyUserId] (or /buddy/[username]) that works on both mobile and desktop.
- In the Buddies list, clicking/tapping a buddy card must navigate to that route.
- If you already have this route, fix whatever is blocking navigation (wrong link, overlay intercepting taps, z-index issues, disabled pointer-events, or missing router push).
- Add a visible “View details” affordance on the buddy card (chevron or button) to make it obvious.

B) Buddy detail screen content
- Top header: buddy name, avatar, and status (buddy/public).
- Date selector: today, yesterday, pick date.
- Anchors list:
  - For each Anchor, show name (or “Completed Anchor” if titles hidden) and completion state for that date.
  - If completed, show a Seen toggle (eye icon) that updates immediately.
  - If not completed, Seen is disabled.
- Show existing reactions separately if they exist, but do not replace Seen functionality.

C) Seen/Watching logic
- If the app uses “Seen” per Anchor check in (AnchorLog), ensure the buddy detail page is wired to that:
  - Fetch buddy anchorLogs for date with viewerHasSeen and seenCount/seenBy.
  - Clicking Seen calls the correct API endpoint to toggle seen for that anchorLogId.
- If “Watching” exists:
  - Define it clearly. If it is just another acknowledgement type, implement it parallel to Seen (unique per anchorLogId and viewerUserId).
  - If Watching is not implemented yet, remove the UI label and keep only Seen, to avoid confusion.

D) Bug diagnosis checklist
- Inspect the buddy card component for:
  - pointer-events: none
  - overlay div covering it
  - incorrect Link href
  - missing router push
  - the buddy id being undefined
- Verify the buddy detail route builds server-side and client-side in production.
- Add a simple integration test or at least a manual test checklist.

Acceptance criteria
- From Buddies list, I can open a buddy detail page.
- I can view their Anchors for today.
- I can mark individual completed Anchors as Seen.
- Changes persist on refresh.

2) ADD NEW BUDDIES TO EXISTING CHATS
Goal: In an existing chat thread (group chat), allow inviting additional buddies to join the chat.

Clarify current model (assume you have DM or group chat)
- If chats are 1:1 only today: upgrade to support group chats.
- If group chats already exist: add “Add members” action.

Data model
- Chat
  - id, createdAt, createdById, isGroup boolean, name nullable
- ChatMember
  - id, chatId, userId, role (ADMIN|MEMBER), joinedAt
  - unique(chatId, userId)
- Message
  - id, chatId, senderId, content, createdAt

Permissions
- Only existing members can see the chat.
- Only ADMIN (or the chat creator) can add members (start with creator only if simpler).
- You can only add users who are:
  - already your buddies OR
  - public users you follow (optional) OR
  - users you can search (if you have public discovery)
Pick the simplest: buddies only.

UI
- In a chat screen, add a top-right menu: “Chat info”
- Chat info shows members list and an “Add people” button.
- Add people opens a picker (mobile bottom sheet) listing my buddies with search.
- On confirm:
  - create ChatMember rows
  - post a system message: “Amin added Sara”
- Newly added members can see message history (or only from join time). Pick one and implement:
  - Simpler: they can see full history.

API
- POST /api/chats/:chatId/members with { userIds: [] }
- GET /api/chats/:chatId returns chat + members
- Ensure auth checks and membership checks.

Acceptance criteria
- I can open an existing chat, tap Chat info, add a buddy, and they appear in the members list.
- Added buddy can access the chat and see messages.
- Works on mobile and desktop.

DELIVERABLES
- Fixed buddy detail navigation and Seen toggling
- Updated chat data model and UI to support adding members to existing chats
- Migrations applied, and deployment updated so it works on https://accountability-game.replit.app/
