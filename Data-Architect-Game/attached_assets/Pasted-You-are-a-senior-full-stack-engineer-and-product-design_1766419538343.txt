You are a senior full stack engineer and product designer. Update the existing Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + Zustand MVP of our grand strategy simulation game (currently called “Insight Empire”) with the amendments below. Keep the game playable and minimal, no backend, localStorage persistence, seeded RNG.

Amendments to implement

1) Clear objective reminder + “how to win” guidelines
- Add a persistent “Mission Brief” panel that always shows:
  - Win conditions (targets for Adoption, Trust, Governance, Reliability, Latency, Cost)
  - Loss conditions (trust collapse, reliability collapse, politics collapse)
  - 5–7 practical guidelines (“How to win”) that are generated from the current scenario and current metrics.
- The guidelines must be dynamic, not static text. Example rules:
  - If Governance < 60 and Trust is falling, recommend adding governance policy before expanding self-service.
  - If Latency rising or high-cardinality event recently occurred, recommend performance tuning before adding more users.
  - If Support load high, recommend enablement or consolidating dashboards.
  - If Political capital low, recommend stakeholder action rather than new deployments.
- Add an optional “Coach Tips” tooltip that explains why each guideline is being suggested (one sentence each).

2) Undo an action
- Implement Undo for the most recent action within the current turn.
- Constraints:
  - Undo should revert state exactly (metrics, deployments, political capital, support load, everything).
  - Undo should also revert any costs and side effects from that action.
  - Undo must NOT rewind the event draw for the turn unless the event was triggered directly by the action. Keep this simple by enforcing a rule:
    - Event is drawn at start of turn and stored, so undo does not change it.
- Implementation approach:
  - Maintain a per-turn action history stack of deep-cloned state snapshots (or state patches).
  - Provide “Undo last action” button disabled when no undo available or after turn resolves.
  - Make sure Undo does not break seeded RNG determinism.

3) Rename the game (catchier, describes Solutions Architect training)
- Replace “Insight Empire” everywhere with a new name and subtitle.
- Propose 8–12 name options, pick the best one, and implement it across UI copy.
- Naming requirements:
  - Should evoke strategy, architecture, and data/analytics transformation.
  - Avoid competitor names.
  - Examples of the vibe: “Architect’s Atlas”, “Data Estate Commander”, “Analytics Command”.
- Also add a short tagline under the title (one line).

4) Mascot / main character
- Add a simple mascot character (vector/SVG or emoji-based) displayed in:
  - Top-left header next to the game title
  - Tutorial overlay and event modal as a “narrator”
  - Mission Brief as the “coach”
- Keep it lightweight (no external image assets required). Use an inline SVG component.
- Give the mascot a name and short personality (1–2 lines) shown in the tutorial.
- Ensure the mascot can “react” with 3–4 expressions (normal, worried, excited, stern) based on current state:
  - worried if Trust < 40 or Reliability < 40
  - stern if Governance < 40 while Adoption > 60
  - excited if all win metrics are trending up
  - normal otherwise

5) Add a compelling story foundation
- Add a “Story Mode” wrapper without changing the core mechanics.
- The story should be grounded in enterprise reality, not fantasy, with light humour.
- Provide:
  - Opening cinematic text (30–60 seconds read) introducing the world, the mission, and the stakes.
  - Scenario intros (2–3 sentences each) explaining why you are taking this approach.
  - Turn-by-turn flavour text in the event modal header that references the story.
- Story premise requirement:
  - The player is a newly appointed Data and Analytics Solutions Architect brought in to unify a fragmented enterprise data estate under tight timelines.
  - There are internal factions, looming audits, executive mandates, and customer-facing embedded analytics pressure.
- Keep writing concise, modern, and motivational. British English.

Acceptance criteria
- The app still runs locally with no errors.
- Mission Brief is always visible and updates dynamically.
- Undo works reliably and does not create weird state drift.
- Game title and subtitle updated everywhere.
- Mascot appears and reacts.
- Story mode text is integrated into the UI (intro screen + per-scenario intro + event flavour line).
- Update README to document the new features and any design choices.

Implementation notes
- Do not add a backend.
- Do not add heavy dependencies. If you need deep clone, use structuredClone or a small helper.
- Keep state logic in a simulation engine module, UI components in components/.
- Make sure all new copy is easy to adjust later (centralise strings).

Now make these changes in the codebase.
