Build My Bold Tech Mentoring Landing Page

	I want you to build a bold, high-converting, mobile-friendly landing page for my adult tech mentoring programme called Break Into Tech Blueprint.

	The goal is to help people:
		•	Stay relevant in an AI-driven world
	•	Build tech skills
	•	Improve their career prospects & confidence
	•	Earn more money

	This page should include:

		•	Bold colours — lightning yellow as primary (#FFD60A or similar)
	•	Clean sans-serif fonts (e.g. Inter, Satoshi, General Sans)
	•	Big bold headlines, rounded buttons, modern spacing
	•	Strong contrast and CTA-focused layout

	📐 Sections & Layout

	1. Hero Section
		•	Headline: “Break Into Tech. Stay Relevant in the Age of AI.”
