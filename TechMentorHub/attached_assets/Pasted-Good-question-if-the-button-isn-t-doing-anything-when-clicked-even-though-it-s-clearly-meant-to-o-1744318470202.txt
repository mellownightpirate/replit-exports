Good question — if the button isn’t doing anything when clicked, even though it’s clearly meant to open a link, here are the most likely causes:

⸻

1. handleClick Prevents Default Behaviour

If your handleClick function includes event.preventDefault(), that would stop the link from opening:

function handleClick(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  // Possibly some logging or other code here
}

This would block the default anchor tag behaviour (i.e., navigating to the link). To fix that, either:
	•	Remove e.preventDefault() if you want the link to function normally,
	•	Or ensure that after your logic, you manually open the link using window.open(...).

⸻

2. JavaScript Error in handleClick

If the function handleClick is throwing an error or not defined properly, it could prevent the rest of the code from executing. Check the browser console for errors.

⸻

3. The Page Is a SPA (Single Page App) with Routing Issues

In frameworks like Next.js or React Router, certain links might not behave as expected if you don’t use their routing components (like <Link> in Next.js). However, since this is an external link with target="_blank", that shouldn’t be the issue unless you’ve overridden <a> behaviour globally somewhere.

⸻

4. The href Is Being Overwritten or Removed by JavaScript

Check to ensure nothing in your component or page logic is dynamically overriding or clearing the href attribute.

⸻

5. Browser or Extension Blocking Popups

If window.open(...) is used within handleClick, it might be blocked by popup blockers depending on timing. However, your code uses href + target="_blank", which should work unless something stops it.

Quick Test: Try Removing onClick

Comment out the onClick:

<a 
  href="https://calendly.com/amin-hasan"
  // onClick={handleClick}
  target="_blank"
  rel="noreferrer noopener"
  className="..."
>

</a>

Then refresh and try clicking it. If it works after removing the onClick, the issue is definitely inside the handleClick function.
