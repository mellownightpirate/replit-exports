Thanks for the clarification, Amin. After analysing the screenshots you’ve shared of your Google Ads campaign, here’s a breakdown of why your ads are getting disapproved and how to fix the issues.

❌ Why Your Google Ads Are Failing

🚨 Primary Issues (from screenshots):
	1.	❗ Compromised Site
	2.	❗ Circumventing Systems

These are serious policy violations in Google’s advertising terms. Let’s explore what they mean and why you’re being flagged.

⸻

🧨 1. Compromised Site

	Definition (by Google):
This means your landing page (https://nextchapter.codes) may have been hacked, contains malware, has suspicious redirects, or hosts unauthorised scripts or suspicious content.

🔍 Evidence in your screenshot:
	•	Under “Assets > Images / Logos” — Google has labelled the site as “Compromised Site”
	•	You’ve also seen Search Console verification fail multiple times, indicating domain-level integrity issues or DNS misconfigurations.

✅ Fix it:
	•	Run a full malware/security scan on your site. Use Google Safe Browsing to check your domain.
	•	Use a free scanner like Sucuri SiteCheck or your hosting provider’s security tools.
	•	If you use Replit, double-check that your Replit-hosted page is not redirecting or using insecure resources.
	•	Remove unused scripts, verify HTTPS/SSL is enabled properly, and ensure you’re not linking to any flagged third-party sites.

🛑 2. Circumventing Systems

	Definition (by Google):
This happens when Google thinks you’re trying to bypass their review or verification processes — such as cloaking content, redirecting users, or using misleading domains.

🔍 Possible triggers:
	•	You’re using Replit for hosting, and it may have auto-redirects, iframes, or URL masking.
	•	Your DNS setup may not match the landing page behaviour.
	•	Google flagged your creative or site content as “trying to mislead” — even if unintentionally.

✅ Fix it:
	•	Remove any unnecessary redirects, URL forwarding, or cloaking (e.g. replit masking your actual domain).
	•	Ensure the destination URL matches the display URL and doesn’t redirect or load third-party scripts on page load.
	•	Temporarily switch from Replit to a cleaner hosting solution like Vercel, Netlify, or even a basic HTML page on GitHub Pages.
	•	Resubmit your site for review via Google Search Console after fixing the DNS TXT issue.

🧩 Supporting Evidence

You’re also seeing:
	•	⚠️ Verification errors in Google Search Console
	•	You correctly created a TXT record with google-site-verification=...
	•	But it’s not yet being detected – likely because the value wasn’t saved properly or DNS propagation hasn’t finished
	•	Google can’t find your site’s ownership verification, which may be fuelling the “Compromised Site” flag.

⸻

✅ Immediate Actions
	1.	Verify your DNS setup:
	•	Go to your domain provider.
	•	Confirm that the TXT record:

google-site-verification=Jxs3LGE-...X46gfmmxPMs

is saved and active.

	•	Use https://dnschecker.org to confirm propagation globally.
	•	Retry verification in Search Console once it resolves.

	2.	Scan your site for issues.
	•	Use Sucuri or Google Safe Browsing.
	3.	Temporarily remove the ad or pause the campaign.
	•	Google penalises repeat violations, so better to pause and fix.
	4.	If using Replit, test a different setup.
	•	Even a minimal site on Vercel/Netlify (no frameworks needed) could clear these issues.

Would you like help setting up a clean hosted version of your landing page on Vercel or Netlify, using your current domain?
That way you can re-verify it, pass the ad policy checks, and go live safely.
