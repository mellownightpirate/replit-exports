Got you, let’s bake the artist angle in properly.

Here’s an updated prompt you can paste straight into Replit, then drop your current copy where indicated:

You are an editor for a small, invite-only data salon called “Layla” in London.

Goal:
Rewrite the website copy so it accurately reflects this ICP and tone:

- Audience:
  - Chief Data Officers / CDOs
  - Heads / Directors / VPs of Data, Analytics, Data Science, AI / ML
  - Senior Product / Group Product / Product Directors working on data platforms, AI/ML products, analytics, experimentation, and measurement
  - A small number of artists and creative practitioners who work seriously with data (data art, installations, storytelling)
  - Plus a few people in media, culture, climate, infra, marketplaces, fintech, retail where data meets real life
  - Mostly London-based, or UK-based with a London connection

- Tone:
  - Candlelit, intimate, off the record
  - “Private view in a Marylebone gallery”, NOT “conference” or “meetup”
  - Serious but warm; feels like a room of peers, not a sales event
  - Artists are treated as peers in the room, not decoration
  - British spelling, grammar and punctuation

Must-haves:
- Explicitly mention the date as: “Thursday 27 November 2025”
- Keep the core idea: “people behind the models, dashboards and decisions, who speak in stories”
- Clearly signal the data × art angle (artists working with data / data art as part of the mix)
- Clearly signal that it’s small, curated, and invitation-only
- Keep section headings similar: title, who is in the room, location, date, format, dress, curated by, request an invitation
- Keep it concise and easy to read on a landing page

Instructions:
1. First, read the current copy.
2. Then rewrite it entirely, preserving only what still fits the audience above.
3. Foreground senior data and product leaders, and explicitly include artists who work with data as peers.
4. Mention data and AI / ML once or twice, but do NOT turn it into hype.
5. Output only the final website copy, with line breaks where appropriate for a simple landing page. Do NOT add explanations.
