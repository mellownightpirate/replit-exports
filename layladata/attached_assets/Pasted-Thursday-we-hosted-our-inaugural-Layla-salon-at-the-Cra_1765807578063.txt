Thursday we hosted our inaugural Layla salon at the Cramer Street Gallery - an intimate, candlelit evening bringing together leaders across data, AI, product and the creative industries.

Our guest speaker was Tom Furse, artist, musician and long-time member of The Horrors, whose work has become synonymous with the use of AI and machine learning in visual art. Tom shared the story of his 15-year career in music, his evolving creative practice, and the way ML has become a collaborator in his process - a tool he shapes, guides and sometimes even “tricks” to reach new aesthetic possibilities.

What stood out was Tom’s clarity on a point often lost in the noise: the artist is still steering the system.

AI expands the palette, but it does not replace vision. In Tom’s words, every new medium begins with imperfections and those imperfections often become the signature of a new aesthetic.

He framed AI not as a rupture, but as the latest chapter in a long lineage: from early synth experiments to generative systems, from sampling culture to today’s models. Creativity has always been a conversation between the artist and their tools and ML is simply the newest voice in that dialogue.

Alongside Tom’s talk, we moved into small-group conversations on:
• AI operating models
• Experimentation and measurement
• Data culture and decision quality
• Platform trade-offs and cost control
• Safety, risk and behaviour in production
• And the broader human experience around the work

What made the evening special wasn’t just the topics it was the room.

Founders, heads of AI, senior product leaders, data scientists, architects and artists whose practices explore machine systems. A group of people genuinely curious about ideas, not airtime.

Layla is designed to be more than a one-off.

We’re building a community that stays connected between gatherings - continuing conversations, forming collaborations, and keeping curiosity alive. Future salons will take new forms, in new venues and (eventually) new cities, but the ethos will stay the same: thoughtful curation, meaningful dialogue, and a blend of technical and creative perspectives.

Thank you to everyone who joined us for the first evening and especially to Tom for such a rich and generous talk.

More soon.
