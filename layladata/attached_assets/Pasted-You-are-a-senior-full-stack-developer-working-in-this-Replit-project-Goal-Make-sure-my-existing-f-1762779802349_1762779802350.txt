You are a senior full-stack developer working in this Replit project.

Goal:
Make sure my existing first-party analytics clearly shows which website visitors came from, using the HTTP referrer. I do NOT want per-user tracking or personalised URLs, just source websites (e.g. linkedin.com, twitter.com, direct).

Please:

1. Confirm referrer is being tracked and stored
   - Check server/analytics-db.ts and the events table:
     - Ensure there is a column for referrer (TEXT).
   - Check client/src/lib/analytics.ts:
     - Ensure page-view events include document.referrer (or an empty string if none).
   - If any of this is missing, add it.

2. Normalise referrer for reporting
   - When storing or querying, derive a simple `referrer_domain` field or value (e.g. linkedin.com, twitter.com, google.com, direct).
   - “Direct” should be used when there is no referrer or it’s empty.

3. Update the analytics dashboard UI (client/src/pages/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx)
   - Add a “Top referrers” section showing:
     - A small list of referrer domains ranked by number of sessions or page views.
   - In the recent events table:
     - Add a “Referrer” column showing either the full referrer URL or just the domain.
   - Optionally add a simple filter box where I can type a domain (e.g. “linkedin.com”) to filter the recent events by that referrer.

4. Keep everything privacy-friendly
   - Do NOT add any third-party trackers or scripts.
   - Do NOT attempt any fingerprinting or per-person identification.
   - Only use the standard document.referrer field and existing session ID.
   - Keep the existing VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS and ANALYTICS_PASSWORD behaviour unchanged.

5. Documentation
   - Update ANALYTICS_README.md and/or ANALYTICS_SUMMARY.md to briefly explain:
     - That referrers (source websites) are tracked.
     - That some visits may appear as “Direct” when referrers are blocked or stripped.
     - Example: LinkedIn DMs usually show as “linkedin.com”.

Finally, show me the modified files and tell me:
- Where in /analytics I can see “Top referrers”.
- How referrers from LinkedIn will appear.
