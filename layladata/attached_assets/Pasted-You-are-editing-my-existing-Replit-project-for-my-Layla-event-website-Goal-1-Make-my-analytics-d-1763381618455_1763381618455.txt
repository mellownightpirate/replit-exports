You are editing my existing Replit project for my Layla event website.

Goal:
1. Make my analytics dashboard accessible at a unique, human readable URL that no one is likely to guess.
2. Remove any requirement for a secret key or password for now, but leave the code easy to secure later.
3. Do NOT break my existing tracking endpoint that records events.

Instructions:

1. Inspect the project and find:
   - The server code that handles HTTP routes (for example an Express "app", Flask app, or similar).
   - Any existing route or page that is used as an analytics dashboard.

2. If there is already an analytics dashboard route:
   - Change its URL path to: `/layla-analytics-aurora-741`.
   - Remove any current middleware that checks for a secret, token, or password.
   - Add a clear code comment above that route explaining where a future auth check can be plugged in, for example:
     `// TODO: when ready, add an auth check here using a SECRET from environment variables`.

3. If there is no analytics dashboard yet:
   - Create a new GET route at `/layla-analytics-aurora-741`.
   - This route should render a simple HTML page (or template, depending on the stack) that:
     a. Shows basic analytics based on the existing stored data. Use whatever storage already exists in the project (for example SQLite, a JSON file, or in memory).
     b. At a minimum, display:
        - Total number of events recorded.
        - Number of unique visitors for the last 7 days.
        - A simple time series of requests in the last 7 days (grouped by hour or by day).
        - Top paths or pages hit.
        - Top referrers.
   - The page should have a heading such as "Layla Analytics" and a short note: "Private analytics URL. Please do not share.".

4. VERY IMPORTANT:
   - Do NOT modify or remove the existing tracking endpoint that collects analytics events.
     For example, if there is a route like `POST /analytics/event` or similar, it must keep working exactly as before.
   - Do NOT require any environment variable, secret, or password to view `/layla-analytics-aurora-741` for now.
   - Do NOT expose the analytics link in the public navigation, footer, or landing page content. It should only be reachable by directly typing the URL.

5. Optional but recommended:
   - Add a `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` tag into the analytics page so search engines do not index it.
   - If the project has `robots.txt`, add a line `Disallow: /layla-analytics-aurora-741`.

After making these changes, show me:
   - The updated route definition for `/layla-analytics-aurora-741`.
   - Any new template or HTML you created for the analytics page.
   - A short explanation of how the analytics page reads the stored data.
