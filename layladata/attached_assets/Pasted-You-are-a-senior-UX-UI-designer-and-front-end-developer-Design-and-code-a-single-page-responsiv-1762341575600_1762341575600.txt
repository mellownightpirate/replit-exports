You are a senior UX / UI designer and front end developer.

Design and code a single-page, responsive landing page for an invitation-only event called **"The Art of Data: After Dark"**.

I want you to output:
1) A short summary of the design concept in 5 bullet points.
2) Then the full HTML for the page in one file, using modern, semantic HTML5.
3) Style it using Tailwind CSS utility classes only (assume Tailwind is already loaded, so do not include the Tailwind CDN or config).
4) Include minimal inline <script> only if absolutely needed for simple interactions.

====================
EVENT AND BRAND BRIEF
====================

Series name: **The Art of Data**  
Edition title: **The Art of Data: After Dark**

Concept:
A candlelit salon for people in data, AI and analytics who actually care about taste. Small, moody, high end, in an atmospheric gallery in Marylebone, London. Think immersive theatre and private views, not beige conference rooms. People working with data and analytics in many roles (founders, C suite, sales engineers, product managers, data leaders, creative technologists, artists working with AI or data).

Audience:
- Industry peers and competitors (data / analytics / AI people who build and sell).
- Buyers and ICPs (CDOs, Heads of Data, data platform leaders, founders).
- Creative technologists and artists who work with data or AI.

Tone:
- Intimate, cinematic, slightly mysterious.
- High end but not stiff. Stylish, confident, a little subversive.
- Human and conversational, no corporate jargon.

Use this core copy. You can lightly edit for flow, but keep the meaning.

Title: The Art of Data: After Dark

Short description:
"The Art of Data: After Dark is a small, invitation-only night for people whose lives revolve around data and AI, but who have had enough of beige conference rooms and panel platitudes.

Set in a dark, candlelit gallery in Marylebone, solutions engineers, founders, C suite, data leaders, product people and artists who work with data meet as themselves, not as job titles on lanyards. Think more private party than trade show, more salon than summit."

Reasons to attend (section heading: "Why come"):
• Meet thoughtful, interesting people from across the data and AI ecosystem, including competitors, partners and potential clients, in a room that feels more like a private party than a networking event.  
• Talk honestly about how data and AI are reshaping your work and your creative practice, without buzzwords, long decks or PR lines.  
• Be part of the early crowd for a new invite-only series that could grow into a valuable network and platform for collaborations and deals.

Practical details (make these into a neat "Event details" module):
- Location: Atmospheric gallery, Marylebone, London (use this as text)
- Date: Late November 2025, evening (placeholder)
- Format: One short conversation or micro panel, then music, drinks and free flowing conversations.
- Dress code: "Come as your most interesting self."

Hosts section:

Host 1:
- Name: Amin Hasan
- Role: Senior Solutions Engineer in data and analytics.
- Line: "Amin lives in the world of data platforms, AI and embedded analytics, and is on a mission to make industry conversations less beige and more human."

Host 2:
- Name: Sara Beazley
- Role: Artist and Product Manager in an art tech startup.
- Line: "Sara sits between art and technology and cares deeply about experiences, taste and how people actually feel in a room."

Call to action:
- Primary CTA button: "Request an invitation"
- Subtext: "This is a curated event with limited spots. Tell us who you are, what you do with data, and who you would love to meet."

The form does NOT need to be functional, but design the form UI as if it will be:
- Fields: Name, Email, Role, Company, "What do you work on with data or AI?", "Who would you love to meet in the room?"

====================
LAYOUT AND STRUCTURE
====================

Use a single-page layout with clear sections in this rough order:

1. Hero section:
   - Dark, cinematic full width hero.
   - Overlaid title "The Art of Data: After Dark" and short description.
   - Strong primary CTA: "Request an invitation".
   - Secondary text: "Marylebone, London · Late November 2025" near the hero.
   - Include a visual placeholder for a hero image (for example, "Gallery interior photo placeholder").

2. Vibe section:
   - A section that communicates the mood visually and in text.
   - Include a 3 column or 2x2 grid of "vibe cards" with short labels like:
     "Candlelit gallery", "Data x Art", "No slides, no waffle", "Invite only crowd".
   - Each card should have a subtle hover effect.

3. Why come:
   - Use the three bullets above as the core content.
   - Lay them out in a clean, readable way, not a wall of text.

4. Event details:
   - A compact panel or card for Location, Date, Format, Dress code.
   - Use simple visual markers or icons (for example, circles or borders created with Tailwind) to make each detail easy to scan.

5. Hosts:
   - Two column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile.
   - Include circular avatar placeholders for Amin and Sara (for example, grey circles with initials "AH" and "SB").
   - Short bios under each.

6. Request an invitation:
   - A visually distinct section (for example, a card or panel) containing the form fields specified above.
   - Clear primary button: "Request an invitation".
   - Brief reassurance text beneath the button: "We will be in touch if there is a good fit."

7. Footer:
   - Very minimal: "The Art of Data · London 2025" and a simple line like "Curated by Amin & Sara".

====================
VISUAL STYLE AND UI REQUIREMENTS
====================

Use Tailwind for all styling.

Overall style:
- Dark theme, but warm and inviting rather than harsh.
- Think candlelight, deep charcoal, subtle warm highlights, Marylebone gallery at night.
- Consider a background that uses a dark gradient overlay on top of either:
  - Subtle abstract shapes suggesting data and networks, or
  - Soft spotlight style gradients that feel like pools of light in a gallery.
- Use plenty of spacing and avoid clutter. This should feel premium and calm.

Typography:
- Use a strong, clean sans serif for headings (Tailwind default stack is fine).
- Consider using uppercase or slightly increased letter spacing for small labels like "Format" or "Location".
- Body text should be highly readable, not too small.

Colour palette (use Tailwind classes, do not invent your own system):
- Backgrounds: combinations like `bg-slate-950`, `bg-slate-900`, `bg-black/90`.
- Accents: warm gold / amber tones, for example `text-amber-300`, `border-amber-400`, `from-amber-500`.
- Text: mostly `text-slate-100` with softer `text-slate-300` for secondary text.
- CTA button: a solid, high contrast button using a warm accent and hover state.

Buttons and interactions:
- Buttons should be nicely rounded (`rounded-full` or `rounded-xl`).
- Use clear hover states (for example, slightly brighter, subtle scale, or ring).
- For cards, use `hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-xl` with smooth `transition`.

Imagery:
- Use image placeholders only, for example divs with gradient backgrounds and overlay text like "Gallery photo placeholder" or "AI / data art placeholder".
- Design them as if we will later drop in:
  - Gallery interior shots from Marylebone.
  - Abstract AI / data art imagery.
- Add HTML comments near each placeholder explaining what type of real image should be inserted later.

Responsiveness:
- Design mobile first.
- On mobile, stack sections vertically with generous padding.
- On desktop, use max width containers (`max-w-6xl mx-auto`) and grid layouts where appropriate.
- Ensure the hero text, form and key information are easily readable on small screens.

Accessibility:
- Maintain sufficient colour contrast.
- Do not use text only inside images for key information.
- Ensure buttons and links are clearly identifiable.

Do not include:
- Any analytics scripts.
- Any external fonts or libraries besides Tailwind classes.
- Any placeholder lorem ipsum. Use the event copy provided and your own short, on brand microcopy.

At the end, briefly explain:
- How you structured the layout.
- Where and how to swap in real gallery / art images once I have them.
