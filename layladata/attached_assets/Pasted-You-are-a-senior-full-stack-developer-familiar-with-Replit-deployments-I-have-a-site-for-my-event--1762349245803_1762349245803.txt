You are a senior full-stack developer familiar with Replit deployments.

I have a site for my event **Layla** deployed on Replit at `layladata.com` (backed by a `.replit.app` app). There is a form on the landing page with these fields:

- Name
- Email
- Role
- Company
- "What do you work on with data or AI?"
- "Who would you love to meet in the room?"

I need you to:

1. Inspect the current code
   - Look through the project files and find:
     - The HTML that defines the form.
     - Any backend code (Python, Node, etc) that might already be handling form submissions.
   - Identify:
     - The current **stack** (for example, static HTML only, Flask app, Node / Express, etc).
     - Whether the form currently has:
       - a `method` attribute, and
       - an `action` URL that points to any backend endpoint.

   - Summarise in 3–5 bullet points how the form is currently wired (or not wired).

2. Decide on the simplest working approach on Replit
   - I do NOT need anything fancy.
   - I want:
     - Submissions to be stored somewhere I can check (for example, Replit Database or a simple JSON / CSV file).
     - Optionally, a console log or very simple admin endpoint so I can see that it works.
   - Choose the simplest approach that:
     - Fits the existing language / stack.
     - Does NOT introduce heavy frameworks.
     - Works on Replit’s deployment model.

   Examples of acceptable approaches:
   - If it is a Python / Flask app:
     - Add a `/submit` route that:
       - Accepts POSTed form data,
       - Stores it in Replit Database or appends to a local JSON file,
       - Returns a simple thank-you page or message.
   - If it is Node / Express:
     - Similar: a POST route and write to a JSON file or Replit Database.
   - If it is completely static:
     - You may add a tiny backend (for example, a minimal Flask or Express server) and adjust the deployment accordingly, OR
     - Integrate a simple form handling service (Formspree, Getform, etc) if that is easier. If you choose a third-party service, explain exactly where I paste the endpoint URL.

3. Implement the solution
   - Update the HTML to:
     - Set `method="POST"`,
     - Set `action` to the correct path (for example, `/submit`).
   - Add the backend handler code:
     - Parse the form fields.
     - Store the submission in a persistent way.
   - Make sure:
     - You handle basic errors safely.
     - You do not expose any secrets.
   - After implementing, show me all changed files in full.

4. Explain how to view submissions
   - In clear, numbered steps, explain:
     - Where submissions are being stored (for example, Replit Database keys, a file path, an admin route).
     - How I can check them inside Replit (for example, using the Database GUI, printing from the console, or visiting a specific route).
   - Add a brief note to the code as a comment or to a README section so future me knows where to look.

5. Test instructions
   - Describe how I can test the form end-to-end on the deployed site:
     - What URL to visit.
     - What to submit.
     - Where to look to confirm that the submission has been received.

Constraints:
- Keep everything as minimal as possible.
- Do not add user authentication, spam filters, or admin dashboards.
- Do not introduce heavy dependencies beyond what the current stack already uses unless absolutely necessary.

Please start by summarising the current state of the form wiring, then propose your chosen approach in 3–4 bullets, and then show the code changes.
