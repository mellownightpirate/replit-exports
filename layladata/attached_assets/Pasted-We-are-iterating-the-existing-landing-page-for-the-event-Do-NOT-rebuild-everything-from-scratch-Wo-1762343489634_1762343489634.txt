We are iterating the existing landing page for the event. Do NOT rebuild everything from scratch. Work from the page you already generated and update the copy and structure with these instructions.

1. Event name and hero

- The event name is now simply: Leila
- Use this exact hero structure and wording:

  Line 1 (title): `Leila`  
  Line 2 (subline): `For the people behind the models, dashboards and decisions, who speak in stories.`  
  Line 3 (meta): `Marylebone, London · Late November 2025`

- Style this like a calm, cinematic poster at the top of the page, with plenty of negative space.

2. Tone and literalness

- Make the copy a bit more ethereal and less literal, while still signalling that it is a night for people who work with data, AI and analytics.
- Remove generic marketing phrases such as “stunning”, “exclusive”, “secure your spot”, “discover”, “unlock”.
- Do NOT describe the page like a marketing funnel. This is an invitation, not a sales page.

3. Paragraph about the room

Find the paragraph that currently reads something like:

“Set in a dark, candlelit gallery in Marylebone, solutions engineers, founders, data leaders, product people and artists who work with data meet as themselves, not as job titles on lanyards.”

Replace it with something in this spirit (you can adjust phrasing slightly, but keep the feeling and roles):

“Set in a dark, candlelit gallery in Marylebone, solutions engineers, founders, data leaders, product people and artists who work with data share the same room for an unhurried night of conversation.”

Important:
- Do NOT mention “job titles on lanyards”.
- Keep it human and understated.

4. “Format” line

Find wherever you currently describe the format as:

“Format: One conversation, then music, drinks and free flowing talk.”

This feels too sequential and too focused on music. Replace it with ONE of these options, and use it consistently:

Option A:
“Format: A loose salon evening with a short opening and plenty of time to talk.”

Option B:
“Format: A brief hosted opening, then an open room of unhurried conversations.”

Option C:
“Format: An evening-length salon where conversations unfold across the room.”

Choose the option that best fits your layout and reuse that exact line in the Event details section. Do not add more literal sequencing like “first X, then Y, then Z”.

5. Layout simplification

Keep the structure simple and artful, not like a SaaS landing page. The sections, in order, should be:

- Hero (Leila + subline + Marylebone line)
- Atmosphere / mood
- Who is in the room
- Event details (Location, Date, Format, Dress code)
- Hosts (small, restrained block with Amin and Sara)
- Single “Request an invitation” form at the bottom

Do NOT:
- Add multiple CTAs.
- Add feature or benefit grids that look like a product page.
- Add testimonials, logos, or pricing.

6. Visual style

- Dark, warm, calm. Think Marylebone gallery at night, not neon cyberpunk.
- Use 1 or 2 strong visual placeholders only (for gallery and art), with comments indicating they will be replaced with real images later.
- Keep using Tailwind CSS classes, no frameworks or build tools. Output a single HTML file only.

7. Output

First, in 4 to 6 bullet points, explain briefly how the updated design and copy now reflect the new name “Leila” and the more ethereal tone.

Then output the FULL updated HTML for the page, with Tailwind classes, incorporating all the changes above.
