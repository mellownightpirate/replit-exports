You are a senior creative director and front end designer.

You have already built a dark, Tailwind styled landing page for **“The Art of Data: After Dark”**.

I now want you to ITERATE on that design with a very different direction:

- Simpler
- Less like a marketing funnel
- More intriguing, poetic and ethereal
- Visually striking and a bit unusual, like an art book or exhibition page, not a SaaS landing page

Please follow these instructions very carefully.

--------------------------------
1. ANALYSE THE CURRENT DESIGN
--------------------------------

Briefly (in 4 to 6 bullet points):

- Describe what the current design is doing in terms of layout and hierarchy.
- Point out where it feels like a typical marketing landing page (for example: hero + benefits + CTA + form, repeated CTAs, “stunning”, “exclusive”, “join us” style copy).
- Identify any clichés in the copy or layout that we should remove.

Do NOT show any code in this section.

--------------------------------
2. NEW CREATIVE DIRECTION
--------------------------------

Use this as the core art direction:

- The event is in an atmospheric gallery in Marylebone at night.
- Think of a cross between:
  - an art exhibition page,
  - an independent magazine,
  - and a film poster site.
- It should feel calm, spacious, slightly mysterious, like you have stumbled on a private invitation.

Apply the following principles:

- **Simplicity**
  - Fewer sections, more negative space.
  - One primary CTA only, at the bottom: the “Request an invitation” form.
  - No repeated buttons all over the page.

- **Typography and layout**
  - Let typography do most of the work.
  - Use large, cinematic headings and short poetic lines.
  - Use more vertical spacing and clear alignment, as if this is a printed poster laid out on the web.
  - It should feel like one continuous scroll, not chopped into “features” and “benefits”.

- **Imagery and visual devices**
  - Use 1 or 2 strong visual placeholders only.
  - For example:
    - A tall, full width hero block that could later hold a gallery interior photo.
    - A smaller “detail” image placeholder lower down.
  - Use gradients, subtle borders and lines sparingly, as if this is a gallery wall, not a dashboard.

- **Tone of voice**
  - Copy should be **less literal, more ethereal**.
  - Avoid generic marketing phrases like:
    - “stunning”, “exclusive access”, “unlock”, “discover”, “networking”, “secure your spot”.
  - Favour short, evocative lines, for example:
    - “A room of people who care about data and taste.”
    - “One conversation, then the rest of the night.”
  - Keep enough concrete info for people to know what it is, but do not over-explain.

--------------------------------
3. CONTENT STRUCTURE (NEW)
--------------------------------

Rebuild the page with a simpler structure:

1. **Hero**
   - Full width, dark, minimal.
   - Title: “The Art of Data: After Dark”.
   - Very short subheading of one or two lines that sets the mood.
   - A single line with “Marylebone, London · Late November 2025”.

2. **Atmosphere section**
   - One short paragraph or a handful of short lines that describe the feeling of the evening.
   - Maybe a simple grid of 3 or 4 words / short phrases (for example: “Candlelight”, “Marylebone gallery”, “Data and art”, “Off the record conversations”).

3. **Who is in the room**
   - Very short descriptions of the people, not in corporate language.
   - For example: “People who build the tools”, “People who buy them”, “People who turn data into art”.

4. **Event details**
   - A compact block with Location, Date, Format, Dress code.
   - Make this visually neat and understated, not loud.

5. **Hosts**
   - Keep Amin and Sara, but make this visually restrained, like a small “credits” block.
   - Simple text, maybe initials in circles, no big profile cards.

6. **Invitation form**
   - Place this at the bottom as the **only** CTA.
   - Form fields: Name, Email, Role, Company, “What do you work on with data or AI?”, “Who would you love to meet in the room?”
   - Short calm heading (for example: “Request an invitation”) and one or two lines explaining that places are limited and curated.

--------------------------------
4. VISUAL STYLE AND IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------

Technical constraints:

- Keep using Tailwind CSS classes only (assume Tailwind is loaded).
- Keep the dark, warm palette, but reduce visual noise. Fewer shadows and glows, more flat calm surfaces.

Visual direction:

- Backgrounds:
  - Use deep, almost black slate and subtle gradients.
- Accents:
  - Use warm amber or gold very sparingly for lines, small labels or hover states.
- Text:
  - Mostly light text on dark background, with clear hierarchy.

Do NOT:

- Add “feature” cards, “benefits” boxes, logos, pricing, testimonials or anything that feels like a marketing funnel.
- Use more than one primary CTA. The form at the bottom is enough.
- Use filler lorem ipsum. Use or lightly adapt the existing event copy, but make it more poetic.

--------------------------------
5. OUTPUT FORMAT
--------------------------------

Now, output:

1) A short written description (5 bullet points) of the NEW design concept, so I can understand the changes.

2) Then the FULL HTML for the page in one file, with Tailwind classes, implementing the new simpler layout and more ethereal tone.

Do not include any build tooling configuration, React components, or framework specific setup. I only want raw HTML that I can drop into a simple static page.
